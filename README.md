A ship is to shoot components such as asteroid or monsters to complete missions. First animation is asteroids rotate 45 degrees and then collisioning other objects,
they are destroyed. Second, we use input from user to control the ship. Using WASD keys or the arrow keys to move. Cliking the mouse, we can see that a bullet flies out.
